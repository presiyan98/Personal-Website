  <p class="Hobbies-p">
    Playing video games helps me to release my stress, also it relaxes me from a hard and long day of university.
    There are both positive and negative effects on playing these games. Most negative effects are endured by excessive playing. Your reflexes might improve if you play games that need timing. You learn English while you play because games are usually in English. Gaming can be addictive! The cons of
    gaming are not that bad, it depends on how much you play and from what point you look at it.

  <li>Programing</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Hobbies-p">I have found my passion and named it my hobby. Programing helped me to develop
     my logical thinking and my mathematical knowlige and skills.
     There is nothing more exciting than solving a coding problem after a long day of working on it.
     That is why I am so passionet about programming.
